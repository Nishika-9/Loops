Algorithms:

A) Factorial-

1) Start

2) Include the necessary C++ libraries.

3) Declare a recursive function to calculate the factorial of an integer.

4) Define the main function:

a. Declare an integer variable n to store the user's input.
b. Prompt the user to enter a positive integer
c. Read the user's input into the variable n.
d. Check if the entered number is non-negative:
     If n is less than 0:
i. Display an error message: "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers."
cpp cout << "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers." << endl;
     If n is non-negative:
i. Calculate the factorial using the factorial function and display the result

5) Define the factorial function:
a. Check for the base case: If n is 0 or 1, return 1.
b. For the recursive case:

6) Calculate the factorial as n times the factorial of n-1.

7) Return the result.

8) End

B) Recursion-

1) Start

2) Include the necessary C++ libraries.

3) Define a recursive function called reverse that takes an integer n as its parameter.

4) In the main function (not explicitly shown in your provided code), you can call the reverse function with a positive integer as an argument to reverse and print its digits in reverse order.

5) End.

C) String_Reverse-

1) Start

2) Include the necessary libraries.

3) Define a recursive function called print_rev that takes a character pointer str as its parameter.

4) In the main function:
a. Declare a character array str to store the input string.
b. Prompt the user to enter a string.
c. Read the user's input into the str array.
d. Call the print_rev function with the str array to reverse and print the string.

6) End

D) Summation-

1) Start

2) Include the necessary C++ libraries.

3) Define a recursive function called print_rev that takes a character pointer str as its parameter.

4) In the main function:
a. Declare a character array str to store the input string.
b. Prompt the user to enter a string.
c. Read the user's input into the str array.
d. Call the print_rev function with the str array to reverse and print the string.

6) End.
